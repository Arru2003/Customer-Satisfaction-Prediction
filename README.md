### Customer Satisfaction Prediction

# Overview

This project focuses on predicting customer satisfaction based on customer support ticket data. It utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze patterns in customer behavior and feedback, enabling organizations to improve customer experience.

# Project Files

1. Customer_Satisfaction_Prediction.ipynb

This Jupyter Notebook contains the implementation of the customer satisfaction prediction model, including:

Data preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature engineering

Model training and evaluation

2. customer_support_tickets.csv

This CSV file contains the dataset used for the prediction task. The data includes information about customer support tickets such as:

Ticket ID

Customer ID

Issue description

Resolution time

Customer feedback

Prerequisites

Tools and Libraries

Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook

pandas

numpy

scikit-learn

matplotlib

seaborn

You can install the required Python libraries using the following command:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

Getting Started

Clone the repository or download the project files.

Open the Customer_Satisfaction_Prediction.ipynb notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.

Place the customer_support_tickets.csv file in the same directory as the notebook.

Run the cells in the notebook sequentially to:

Load and preprocess the data

Explore the data

Train and evaluate the machine learning model

Data Description

The dataset includes the following columns:

Ticket ID: Unique identifier for each support ticket

Customer ID: Unique identifier for each customer

Issue Description: Textual description of the customer's issue

Resolution Time: Time taken to resolve the issue (in hours/days)

Customer Feedback: Numerical or categorical feedback provided by the customer

Model Workflow

Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values

Encode categorical variables

Scale numerical features

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize data distributions

Analyze relationships between features

Feature Engineering:

Extract meaningful features from textual descriptions

Engineer features like ticket priority and resolution efficiency

Model Training:

Train machine learning models such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, or Gradient Boosting

Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Results

The notebook outputs the performance of the trained models and provides insights into the factors affecting customer satisfaction.

Future Enhancements

Incorporate additional datasets to improve model generalizability.

Explore advanced techniques such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) for analyzing textual descriptions.

Develop a web application for real-time prediction of customer satisfaction.
